Types of ML - 
A] Supervised ML (Learn to predict target values from labelled data)
   a] Classification (target values are discrete classes)
   b] Regression (target values are continuous values)

B] Unsupervised ML (Find structure or knowledge in unlabeled data)
   - Find groups of similar instances in data (clustering)
   - Finding unusual patterns (outlier detection)

Basic ML Workflow -
Representation -> Evaluation -> Optimization
Loop between Evaluation and Optimization
